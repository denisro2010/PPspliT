1.3 (Nov 2011)
- Improved handling of effects affecting text paragraphs instead of entire
  shapes. This should solve issues such as lost text styles (bold, italic,
  underline, etc.) and early appearing paragraphs in the split slides.
- Fixed a small bug which caused incorrect handling of rotation emphasis
  effects. The bug affected shapes that were already rotated before applying
  the effect.
- Improved handling of shape resize emphasis effects in Office <=2003: now
  the font size is more likely to be correctly updated even when the effect
  operates on a group of shapes. Note that: 1) font size for text boxes
  in nested groups will still not be updated, and 2) sometimes the font size
  may be scaled incorrectly (guess why? Because PowerPoint returns a garbled
  size for existing text).
- Improved handling of entry effects for shapes that have an entry effect
  on their own + an entry effect for each text paragraph they have inside.
- (Again) improved icon for Office XP (2002) and 2003. Now it should match
  the button icon size, so that ugly scalings do not happen any longer.
- The installer should now correctly issue a warning also when at least one
  of the detected Office releases is not recognized (e.g., Office 2000).

1.2 (Oct 2011)
- Improved (un)installer: now (un)configures the add-in for every
  installed PowerPoint releases, not just the first one.
  Moreover, detection of installed PowerPoint releases has been improved.

1.1 (Dec 2010)
- Worked around a PowerPoint bug affecting handling of effects with
  the "hide on next mouse click" option activated.
- Fixed a bug in the update of the progress bar which caused a crash
  when handling effects with the "hide on next mouse click" option
  activated.
- Support for Office 2010, both 32 and 64 bit versions. Installer
  automatically recognizes the correct architecture.
- Slightly improved button icon for Office XP (2002) and 2003.

1.0 (Nov 2009)
- First release

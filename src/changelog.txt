1.14 (August 2015)
- Improved handling of animations of text paragraphs.
  In particular, copying paragraphs between shapes sometimes required
  inserting an additional newline character at the paragraph end, which was
  never later removed. Although generally harmless, this caused text
  alignment to be garbled in some cases, especially when text was
  vertically aligned at bottom. Now injected newline characters are
  automatically removed after processing the relevant paragraphs (thanks to
  John Rowe for isolating the issue in a minimal example).

1.13 (February 2015)
- Improved processing of bullet formatting in itemized lists. Still far
  from being perfect, but a richer number of cases should now be correctly
  handled (thanks to Scott Otterson for sending a minimal example
  triggering a specific instance of the problem).

1.12 (October 2014)
- Fixed a bug in the clearParagraph subroutine: the bullet character was
  improperly set to character 160, but it had to be set to character 32
  (space) instead (thanks to Leon Carvalho for pointing this out).

1.11 (Jul 2013)
- Fixed a bug that could cause crashes of the add-in in at least 50% of the
  installations when processing path motion effects. Evidence of the bug
  depended on the nationality where the add-in was installed (yes, it's not
  a joke!)
  The bug lied in the conversion of decimal separator characters from the
  '.' character used in the internal representation of path motion effects
  to the character adopted in the host machine's locale setting.

1.10 (May 2013)
- Fixed a small bug that could cause a crash when fixing slide numbers in
  the presence of multiple slide masters (the first slide master was not
  always displayed as the current master, causing shape selection to fail
  in some cases). This bug only affected the implementation for PowerPoint
  <=2003.
- Fixed a glitch with the detection of the selected slide range. It only
  affected splitting on a selected range of slides, and caused errors in
  recognizing the range if slides were not selected in the order in which
  they appeared in the presentation. Now the range is assumed to start at
  the lowest numbered selected slide and to end at the highest numbered
  selected slide: regardless of the range being contiguous or not, all the
  slides in between are processed.
- Reversed semantic for internal variables representing the status of the
  "Split on mouse click" and "Adjust slide numbers" buttons. This has no
  impact on the final user except that, in case of failure of the add-in,
  the internal status is reverted to "True" for both of them (until now
  it was reverted to "False"), regardless of the status of the buttons.

1.9 (May 2013)
- Fixed a (very subtle) problem that caused skipping of some animation
  effects in the timeline during the preprocessing phase that deletes
  shapes that are supposed to appear later in a slide. The problem occurred
  when, during that phase, deletion of a shape caused disappearance
  from the timeline of effects for the same shape that preceded the
  currently processed effect.
- Fixed release number in the about dialog for PowerPoint 2003.
- Fixed progress percentage indication during the initial phase that fixes
  slide numbers (it contained decimals).

1.8 (Mar 2013)
- Fixed some problems with animated text ranges containing text with
  superscript or subscript style.
- Very minor fixes in the PowerPoint 2003 toolbar (there was a missing
  button group separator).
- Removed a misplaced comment about the unsupported features in the
  source code for PowerPoint 2007.
- The progress bar documenting the advancement of the slide number
adjustment
  missed the percentage value in PowerPoint 2007.


1.7 (Jan 2013)
- If slide numbers are displayed in slide footers, it is now possible to
  keep them consistent with those appearing in the original presentation:
  if splitting a single slide from the original presentation results in
  several slides, the same slide number is displayed for all of them.
- When applying an animation effect to a placeholder for the first time,
  the "animate background shape" option is disabled but implicitly
  activated. Relevant effects now take this into account and implicitly
  assume that the whole shape is to be animated when it is a placeholder.
- The ChangeLineColor emphasis effect did not apply correctly if the
  shape had no line shown. Same for the ChangeFillColor effect. Fixed.
- Improved Office XP/2003 toolbar.
- Added an about dialog box.

1.6 (Sep 2012)
- Removed the progress bar from the progress form. This solves problems
  with missing Microsoft Form controls and relaxes architecture
  dependency.

1.5 (Jan 2012)
- Fixed a small regression.
  There is a special case when for a text box there are separate animations
  for the shape and the contained text. In this case, just after having
  pasted the box to implement an entry effect, the text contents must be
  immediately deleted by the applyEffect function itself if they are
  supposed to appear later on, because they have been pasted together with
  the shape.
  Now, this behaviour must be restricted to entry effects for text
  paragraphs only. Applying the same behaviour (i.e., purging future
  effects immediately after pasting a shape) to every shape leads to
  incorrect results.


1.4 (Jan 2012)
- Solved a small bug in shape scaling effects.
  Resizing failed for all shapes having a locked aspect ratio and text
  frames where text auto-fitting was enabled.

1.3 (Nov 2011)
- Improved handling of effects affecting text paragraphs instead of entire
  shapes. This should solve issues such as lost text styles (bold, italic,
  underline, etc.) and early appearing paragraphs in the split slides.
- Fixed a small bug which caused incorrect handling of rotation emphasis
  effects. The bug affected shapes that were already rotated before
  applying
  the effect.
- Improved handling of shape resize emphasis effects in Office <=2003: now
  the font size is more likely to be correctly updated even when the effect
  operates on a group of shapes. Note that: 1) font size for text boxes
  in nested groups will still not be updated, and 2) sometimes the font
  size
  may be scaled incorrectly (guess why? Because PowerPoint returns a
  garbled
  size for existing text).
- Improved handling of entry effects for shapes that have an entry effect
  on their own + an entry effect for each text paragraph they have inside.
- (Again) improved icon for Office XP (2002) and 2003. Now it should match
  the button icon size, so that ugly scalings do not happen any longer.
- The installer should now correctly issue a warning also when at least one
  of the detected Office releases is not recognized (e.g., Office 2000).

1.2 (Oct 2011)
- Improved (un)installer: now (un)configures the add-in for every
  installed PowerPoint releases, not just the first one.
  Moreover, detection of installed PowerPoint releases has been improved.

1.1 (Dec 2010)
- Worked around a PowerPoint bug affecting handling of effects with
  the "hide on next mouse click" option activated.
- Fixed a bug in the update of the progress bar which caused a crash
  when handling effects with the "hide on next mouse click" option
  activated.
- Support for Office 2010, both 32 and 64 bit versions. Installer
  automatically recognizes the correct architecture.
- Slightly improved button icon for Office XP (2002) and 2003.

1.0 (Nov 2009)
- First release
